# Contributing to Pigment CSS

## Pigment CSS vs. MUI organization

Pigment CSS is an open-source project of the MUI organization. The repositories are part of the same codebase.
`mui/pigment-css` imports the code infrastructure from [`mui/material-ui`](https://github.com/mui/material-ui).
You can find the "contributing" guide for the main repository in [mui/material-ui/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Most of the content in the main repository "contributing" guide applies to this repository.
There are, however, a few differences:

- The default GitHub branch might be different.
- The local documentation site opens on a different port: 3006 instead of 3000.
